  "GoodPlace is about getting a good place to start a product or
   tool with a relatively simple architecture and good enough
   performance. There are tons of tradeoffs within all of which
   will shed some people's interest, but that's okay. I think
   there's enough in here to remain interesting and I've been
   delighted by how easy it can be to add routes, pages and new
   functionality.")
